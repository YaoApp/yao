## What is Yao?

Yao is an all-in-one application engine that enables developers to create web apps, REST APIs, business applications, and more, with AI as a development partner.

Yao lets you create apps using AI, a visual interface, or by writing them yourself. Its DSL (Domain-Specific Language) is easy to read and write, and it works well with AI. With full programming capabilities and a single command-line tool to handle everything, you can switch smoothly between manual coding and AI assistance, making web app development fast and flexible.

## Features

Yao is effective in both human and machine programming, with each being independent, allowing for seamless switching between the two.

### 🔮 AI First

We have designed a human-machine-friendly DSL (Domain-Specific Language) that makes both AI-generated and manually written code more efficient, enabling easy transitions between the two.

Typically, AI generates the initial code, and developers make modifications, significantly boosting development efficiency. In practice, AI can handle 80% to 90% of the work, allowing developers to focus on the remaining 10% to 20%.

### 🔮 All-in-One

Yao is an all-in-one solution for web development, requiring no additional packages or toolchain dependencies. It ships as a single executable file that includes everything you need to get started.

This greatly reduces the complexity of interacting with AI, significantly improving both the efficiency and quality of the generated code. It also eliminates many unnecessary tasks, allowing developers to focus on more important aspects.

### 🔮 Native TypeScript Support

Yao includes a built-in V8 engine with TypeScript support, allowing direct code execution and providing hundreds of APIs for databases, files, caching, and more, with multiple ways to add extensions.

Yao offers comprehensive programming capabilities, so you don’t have to worry about being unable to implement certain features.

### 🔮 Multiple Coding Approaches

Combine AI-generated code, visual editing, and manual coding within the same project, with generated code that is easy to read and manually modify.

Once you understand how Yao works and its DSL, you can easily develop a code generator or AI agent tailored to your business needs.

### 🔮 Serverless

Launch in seconds with built-in cloud functions and API gateways to easily create server-side apps. Integrate seamlessly with the DevOps ecosystem for one-click deployment.

### 🔮 Edge Devices Support

Yao apps also support running on edge devices equipped with arm64 or x64 chips, suitable for various scenarios in IoT applications.

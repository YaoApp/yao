[中文介绍](README.zh-CN.md)

YAO is an open-source application engine, written in Golang, in the form of a command-line tool that can be downloaded and used immediately. It is suitable for developing business systems, website/APP API, admin panel, self-built low-code platforms, etc.

YAO adopts a flow-based programming model to implement various functions by writing YAO DSL (Logical Description in JSON format) or using JavaScript to write processes. The YAO DSL can be written in several ways:

1. Purely hand-written

2. Use automated scripts to generate contextual logic

3. Use the visual editor to create by "drag and drop"

## Introduce

**Yao allows developers to create web services by processes.** Yao is a app engine that creates a database model, writes API services, and describes dashboard interface just by JSON for web & hardware, and 10x productivity.

Yao is based on the **flow-based** programming idea, developed in the **Go** language, and supports multiple ways to expand the data stream processor. This makes Yao extremely versatile, which can replace programming languages ​​in most scenarios, and is 10 times more efficient than traditional programming languages ​​in terms of reusability and coding efficiency; application performance and resource ratio Better than **PHP**, **JAVA** and other languages.

Yao has a built-in data management system. By writing **JSON** to describe the interface layout, 90% of the common interface interaction functions can be realized. It is especially suitable for quickly making various management background, CRM, ERP and other internal enterprise systems. Special interactive functions can also be implemented by writing extension components or HTML pages. The built-in management system is not coupled with Yao, and any front-end technologies such as **VUE** and **React** can be used to implement the management interface.

## About Yao

Yao's name is derived from the Chinese character **爻 (yáo)**, the basic symbol that makes up the Eight Trigrams. The Eight Trigrams is a symbol system created by the ancient god Fuxi after observing and summarizing the laws of nature, which can refer to everything. Yao has two states of yin and yang, like 0 and 1. The transformation of yin and yang of Yao drives the replacement of Eight Trigrams, so as to summarize and record the development law of things.

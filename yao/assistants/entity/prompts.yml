    Extract entities and relationships from text for knowledge graph construction.

    ## Task
    1. Identify named entities (Person, Organization, Location, Product, Event, Concept, etc.)
    2. Extract relationships between entities
    3. Return structured JSON

    ## Response Format (JSON only)
    ```json
    {
      "entities": [
        {"id": "e1", "name": "Entity Name", "type": "Person|Org|Location|Product|Event|Concept", "properties": {}}
      ],
      "relationships": [
        {"source": "e1", "target": "e2", "type": "relationship_type", "properties": {}}
      ]
    }
    ```

    ## Guidelines
    - Use consistent entity IDs (e1, e2, ...)
    - Normalize entity names (remove titles, standardize format)
    - Common relationship types: WORKS_FOR, LOCATED_IN, OWNS, CREATED, RELATED_TO
    - Keep properties minimal and relevant
    - Same language as input for entity names
